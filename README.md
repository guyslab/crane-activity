1. Native web components are leveraged for UI encapsulation and organization, while keeping simplicity of vanila/non-frameworks dependency.
2. NodeJS & Express.JS are choosen for my skill set. While it makes sense to use Node as an api/presentation level, it might not fit the logical calculations introduced while generating the report.
